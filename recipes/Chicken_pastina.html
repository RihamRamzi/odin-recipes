    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chef John's chicken pastina is like a big, warm hug from an Italian
      grandma, a comfort food that will, quite literally, change your mood. You
      can make this simple soup with a fortified broth if you have the time, or
      simply use off-the-shelf chicken broth for the 15-minute version.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups prepared chicken broth</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 cup stelline (star-shaped) pastina, or other pastina such as acini di
        pepe
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>
        3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (1 1/2 ounces by
        weight)
      </li>
      <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring broth to a simmer over medium-high heat. Taste; season with salt
        if needed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium, and stir in pastina. Cook, stirring occasionally,
        for about 30 seconds less than the package directions, 5 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Turn off heat, and stir in black pepper, butter, and grated cheese. Stir
        constantly until butter disappears. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure
        to build.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Ladle pastina into hot bowls, top with more freshly ground black pepper
        and Parmigiano Reggiano, and drizzle with olive oil.
      </li>
    </ol>
